# Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution! Feedback, [bug reports](https://github.com/buildit/gravity-particles/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and [feature requests](https://github.com/buildit/gravity-particles/issues/new?template=feature-request.md) can be just as valuable as code contributions!

If you want to make code contributions, please follow the process outlined below. Whether you have a specific fix or feature in mind already, or if you have spare time and just want to help out - we'd love to hear from you!


## Code contributions

### Process

To avoid wasted effort, please always follow this process:

1. **Reach out to the [Gravity maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/buildit/teams/gravity-maintainers)** to discuss what you want to do.
    * This helps avoid duplicate work - someone else might already be working on the same thing you were going to do!
    * The maintainers can also help you determine how best to architect your contribution
1. **Create a feature branch**
    * As per our [branching strategy](./docs/branching-strategy.md)
1. **Write your code**
    * Make sure you follow all the relevant conventions (see next section)
1. **[Create a pull request](https://github.com/buildit/gravity-particles/pulls)** once your code is ready
    * The maintainers will then review your code and, if necessary, request changes
    * Once approved, your PR will be merged and the associated feature branch will be deleted.


### Code conventions and other important info

Before diving into the code, please familiarise yourself with the following:

* Our [branching strategy](./docs/branching-strategy.md)

Any code contributions that do not follow these conventions is likely to be rejected!
