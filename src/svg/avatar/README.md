# Avatar SVGs

The SVGs in this folder can safely be used as avatars (aka profile pictures). They each have the following characteristics:

* Their canvas (i.e. viewbox) has a 1:1 aspect ratio (64 x 64 recommended).
* The design can be displayed with rounded corners or cropped to a circular shape without any important elements being omitted.
* The designs do not use any stroke styles. They are made up entirely of filled shapes and paths.
* The designs may be filled with a single colour.
    * However, some may define up to 3 additional areas that may be filled independently with highlight colours. Where this is the case, they will use the following class names: `grav-svg-hl-1`,  `grav-svg-hl-2` and  `grav-svg-hl-3`.
