# Logo SVGs

The SVGs in this folder are Buildit-related logos. These files should be considered the definitive, master versions of Buildit's logos.

They each have the following characteristics:

* Their canvas (i.e. viewbox) does not have any padding. In other words it should shrink-wrap the logo design.
* Their apsect ratios are unpredictable. No assumptions should be made about them.
* The designs do not use any stroke styles. They are made up entirely of filled shapes and paths.
* The designs may be filled with a single colour.
    * However, some may define up to 3 additional areas that may be filled independently with highlight colours. Where this is the case, they will use the following class names: `grav-svg-hl-1`,  `grav-svg-hl-2` and  `grav-svg-hl-3`.
