# User interface SVGs

The SVGs in this folder are icons and symbols to be used within Gravity-styled UIs. They each have the following characteristics:

* Their canvas (i.e. viewbox) has a 1:1 aspect ratio (32 x 32 recommended).
* The design _may_ extend to any edge of the canvas. Therefore, these SVGs must be displayed in their entirety and not be cropped in any way.
* The designs do not use any stroke styles. They are made up entirely of filled shapes and paths.
* The designs are intended to be filled with a single, arbitrary colour.
    * Whatever fill colour these master files use are for ease of editing only - they will be discared when the output files are generated.
